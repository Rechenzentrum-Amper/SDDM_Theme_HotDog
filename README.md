# SDDM_Theme_HotDog
SDDM Theme HotDog is a light and clean theme for the Simple Desktop Display
Manager. It is the recommended display manager theme to login to your suckless
dynamic window manager. This theme is based on QtQuick2.

The wallpaper was probably taken from a misguided thread on 4chan.org/b/.

## Installation
Installation should be easy. Simply put the folder named 'hotdog' to your sddm
themes folder.
```
sudo cp -r hotdog /usr/share/sddm/themes
```

Enjoy and don't fuck things up.-)
